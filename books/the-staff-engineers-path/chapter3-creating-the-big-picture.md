# Chapter 3. Creating the Big Picture

## What’s a Vision? What’s a Strategy?

- there can be disadvantages when each team decides for itself:
  - There can be a “tragedy of the commons”, where teams pursuing their own best action without coordinating with others leads to an outcome that is bad for everyone. There’s that local maximum again.
  - Shared concerns can be neglected because no one group has the authority or an incentive to fix them alone.
  - Teams may be missing enough context to make the best decision. The people taking action might be different from the people experiencing the outcomes, or might be separated in time from them.
  
#### What’s a Technical Vision?

- A technical vision describes the future as you’d like it to be once the objectives have been achieved and the biggest problems are solved.
- A vision creates a shared reality.
- A technical vision is sometimes called a “north star” or “shining city on the hill.”
- It doesn’t set out to make all the decisions, but it should remove sources of conflict or ambiguity
- Whatever you create, it should be clear and opinionated, it should describe a realistic better future, and it should meet your organization’s needs.

#### What’s a Technical Strategy?

- A strategy is a plan of action. It’s how you intend to achieve your goals, navigating past the obstacles you’ll meet along the way.
- a technical strategy should bring clarity—not about the destination, but about the path there.
- A strategy won’t make all the decisions, but it should have enough information to overcome whatever difficulties are stopping the group from getting to where it needs to go.
- It will likely include a diagnosis of the current state of the world, including specific challenges to be overcome, and a clear path forward for addressing those challenges.
  - The diagnosis
  - Guiding policy
  - Coherent actions
- Finally, a strategy isn’t an aspirational description of what someone else would do in a perfect world. It has to be realistic and acknowledge the constraints of your situation. A strategy that can’t get staffed in your organization is a waste of your time.

#### Do You Really Need Vision and Strategy Documents?

- Writing technical vision or strategy takes time. If you can achieve the same outcome in a more lightweight way, do that instead. Create what your organization needs and no more.

## The Approach

#### Embrace the Boring Ideas

#### Join an Expedition in Progress

- Share the lead
- Follow their lead
- Step away
  - A third approach, of course, is to decide the work is going to succeed without you, be enthusiastic about it, and go find something else to do. If the project doesn’t need you, find one that does.
- If there really is no way for multiple people to succeed on the same project without playing ape games, consider going somewhere with more available scope (and a healthier culture).
  
#### Get a Sponsor

#### Choose Your Core Group

- keep the core group manageable: two to four people (including you) is ideal.
- A time commitment can help you here

#### Set Scope

- Be practical about what’s possible.

#### Make Sure It’s Achievable

- A practical step you can take here is to talk with someone who’s done something similar before.
- If, at the end of this analysis, you decide that the problem isn’t solvable, or at least not by you, you have five options:
  - Lie to yourself, cross your fingers, and do it anyway.
  - Recruit someone who has skills that you’re missing, and either work with them or ask them to lead the project
  - Reduce your scope
  - Accept that nobody’s going to write a vision/strategy to solve the problems you can see, conclude that your company will probably be OK without one, and go work on something else.
  - Accept that nobody’s going to write a vision/strategy to solve the problems you can see, conclude that your company won’t be OK without one, and update your resume.

#### Make It Official

- Here’s a checklist to consider before starting to create a technical vision or strategy.
  - [x] We need this.
  - [x] I know the solution will be boring and obvious.
  - [x] There isn’t an existing effort (or I’ve joined it).
  - [x] There’s organizational support.
  - [x] We agree on what we’re creating.
  - [x] The problem is solvable (by me).
  - [x] I’m not lying to myself on any of the above.
- If you do feel ready to go, though, here’s one final question: are you ready to commit to the work and start working on it “out loud”?
- Your level of transparency here will depend on your knowledge of your organization: think about the topographical map you made last chapter. If you can be open about work like this, it will be easier for people to bring you information and gravitate toward you to help.

## The Writing

#### The Writing Loop

- Initial ideas
- What documents already exist?
- What needs to change?
- What’s great as it is?
- What’s important?
- What will Future You wish that Present You had done?

#### Make Decisions

- Trade-offs
- Building consensus
- Not deciding is a decision (just usually not a good one)
- Show your work
  - However you make the decision, document it, including the trade-offs you considered and how you got to the decision in the end.

#### Get Aligned and Stay Aligned

- Be reasonable
- Nemawashi
  - nemawashi, one of the pillars of the Toyota Production System. It means sharing information and laying the foundations so that by the time a decision is made, there’s already a consensus of opinion.
  - I’ve always framed this as “Don’t call for a vote until you know you have the votes,” but I was delighted to learn that there’s a word for it.
- Work on your story

#### Create the Final Draft

- Think about how you can make it easy to read, or share the highlights in another way.
- Avoid dense walls of text. Use images, bullet points, and lots of white space.
- One way is to use “personas”: describe some of the people affected by your vision or strategy—developers, end users, or whoever your stakeholders are—and describe their experience before and after the work is done.

## The Launch

#### Make It Official

- Make sure your document looks real. Host it on an official-looking internal website. Close any remaining comments and remove any to-dos. Consider removing the ability to add comments, and leave a contact address for feedback instead.

#### Keep It Fresh

- The business direction or broader technical context may change and you’ll need to adapt. You may also just find out that the direction you chose was wrong. It happens.
- If the vision or strategy is no longer solving your business problems, don’t be afraid to iterate on it.

## To Recap

- A technical vision describes a future state. A technical strategy describes a plan of action.
- Have a plan up front for how to make the document become real. That usually means having an executive as a sponsor.
- Be deliberate about agreeing on a document type and a scope for the work.
- Writing the document will involve many iterations of talking to other people, refining your ideas, making decisions, writing, and realigning. It will take time.
- Your vision or strategy is only as good as the story you can tell about it.
