# Chapter 2. Three Maps

## Uh, Did Anyone Bring a Map?

#### A Locator Map: You Are Here

- Think of it like one of those maps that a news station throws up behind the presenter to remind you where a particular place is, and put it in context.
- You need the locator map because it’s tricky to be objective about any work while you’re deep inside it.

#### A Topographical Map: Learning the Terrain

- Despite the dangers and difficulties, you might find that there are navigable paths already in place. Discovering these paths will include understanding your organization’s “personality” and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made, and uncovering both the official and the “shadow” organization charts.

#### A Treasure Map: X Marks the Spot

- The third map has a destination and some points on a trail to get there. It shows where you’re going and lays out some of the stops on the journey.

#### Clearing the Fog of War

- When you join a new company, most of the big picture is completely unknown to you. A big part of starting a new job is building context, learning how your new organization works, and uncovering everyone’s goals.
  - Your locator map can help you make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.
  - Your topographical map can help highlight the friction and gaps between teams and open up the paths of communication.
  - Your treasure map can help you make sure everyone knows exactly what they’re trying to achieve and why.
- What sorts of facts are useful? Anything that can help you or others have context for your work, navigate your organization, or progress toward your goals. Here are some examples:
  - A company all-hands presentation about an upcoming marketing push might be a hint that huge traffic spikes you’re not ready for are coming your way.
  - Your director asks you to take on a project you don’t have time to do, but you know which senior engineers in your organization are ready for opportunities to stretch their skills.
  - A shift in corporate priorities could mean a platform you’d considered but backburnered has become an amazing investment.
  - Your database just disappeared, and you remember getting an email about network maintenance.

## The Locator Map: Getting Perspective

- As you understand the people, the problems, and the goals, you’ll become more focused on them. That focus brings depth and understanding, but it comes with some risks, especially for a staff engineer.
  - Prioritizing badly
    - The more time you spend staring at your own group’s problems, the more they seem special and unique and worthy of special, unique solutions. And sometimes they are! But it’s unusual to find a problem that is genuinely brand new. If you check for prior art and preexisting solutions, you’ll spend less time reinventing wheels.
  - Losing empathy
    - Loss of empathy shows up in incidents, too, where teams can get absorbed in the interesting technical details of the problem and forget there are users waiting for the system to be back online.
  - Tuning out the background noise
    - If you’ve been working around the same mucky configuration file or broken deploy process for months, you might get so used to it that you stop thinking of it as something you need to fix. Similarly, you might not notice that something that started out as just slightly annoying has slowly become worse.
  - Forgetting what the work is for
    - If you’re working only on your own little part of a project, it’s easy to stop thinking about what the project is for. You can slip into a world where everyone does their own little part and nobody feels like they’re responsible for the end result.

#### Seeing Bigger

- without perspective, you can’t do impactful work.

###### Taking an outsider view

- Being new is the best opportunity you’ll have to get a complete outsider view, but as a staff engineer, you should try to have this perspective all the time.
- You need to be able to look at your own group as if you weren’t part of it and to be honest about what you see.

###### Escaping the echo chamber

###### What’s actually important?

- Befriending nonengineers is good for your perspective in another way: As an engineer, it’s easy to get absorbed in technology. But technology is a means to some end. Ultimately you’re here to help your employer achieve its goals. You should know what those goals are. You should know what’s important.
- The ordering will change over time, so understand what matters right now. If your customers are leaving in droves because your product is missing core features that your competitors have, it’s probably not the time to push for a focus on technical debt. If everything is smooth sailing and you’re anticipating growth, this might be a great time to make sure your foundations are solid.

###### What do your customers care about?

- Charity Majors, CTO of Honeycomb, often hands out stickers that say: “Nines don’t matter when users aren’t happy.”
- You need to measure success from your users’ point of view.

###### Have your problems been solved before?

- Amazon’s tenet of “respect what came before” includes a reminder that “many problems are not essentially new.”

## The Topographical Map: Navigating the Terrain

- A locator map gives perspective, but you can’t navigate by it. You need another map: one that shows the terrain.

#### Rough Terrain

- Your good ideas don’t get traction
  - Being right about a need for change is less than half the battle. You’ll have to convince other people that you’re right and, even more difficult, convince them to care that you’re right.
- You don’t find out about the difficult parts until you get there
- Everything takes longer
  - Unless you know how your organization works, decisions that should be straightforward will take months or quarters.

#### Understanding Your Organization

- What’s the culture?
- Secret or open?
- Oral or written?
- Top-down or bottom-up?
  - Where do initiatives come from?
  - Staff+ engineers should be fairly autonomous and self-directed, but make sure your organization agrees
- Fast change or deliberate change?
- Back channels or front doors?
- Allocated or available?
  - How much time does everyone have? If teams are understaffed and overworked, you’ll have trouble finding a foothold for any new idea that isn’t on an existing product road map
- Liquid or crystallized?
  - Where do power, status, and reputation come from? How do you gain trust?
- Power, rules, or mission?
  - Westrum classified organizations and their influence on information flows using three categories
    - Pathological
      - A low-cooperation culture where power and status are the goal and people hoard information; in Westrum’s words, “a preoccupation with personal power, needs, and glory”
    - Bureaucratic
      - A rule-oriented culture where information moves through standard channels and change is difficult; the preoccupation here, Westrum writes, is with “rules, positions, and departmental turf”
    - Generative
      - A mission-oriented, high-trust, high-cooperation culture where information flows freely; Westrum calls this “concentration on the mission itself”
- Noticing the points of interest
- Chasms
- Fortresses
  - Fortresses are teams or individuals who seem determined to stop anyone from getting projects done.
  - To pass through the fortress gates, you might need to bring a token of sponsorship from someone the gatekeeper respects, or know the password to lower the drawbridge.
- Disputed territory
  - It’s very hard to draw team boundaries in a way that lets each team work autonomously. No matter how opinionated your APIs, contracts, or team charters, there will inevitably be some pieces of work that multiple teams think they own, and navigating those disputes can feel risky.
- Uncrossable deserts
- Paved roads, shortcuts, and long ways around

#### What Points of Interest Are on Your Map?

- How are decisions made?
  - Some decisions seem to emerge from conversations without anyone really declaring that they’ve decided. Others happen more formally, but in rooms you’re not in.
  - being technically correct about a direction is only the beginning. You need to convince other people too—and you need to convince the right people.
- Where is “the room”?
  - decisions are also being made directly at your scope, and, as much as possible, you’ll want to be involved.
  - “in the room where it happens.”
- Asking to join in
- The shadow org chart
  - While it’s important to understand who the official technical leaders are, it’s just as important to understand who they listen to and how they make decisions.

#### Keeping Your Topographic Map Up to Date

- On an average day, you might need to know that:
  - A team you depend on has a new lead.
  - A project you’ve been waiting for isn’t happening after all.
  - Quarterly planning is about to start.
  - A useful new platform is launching.
  - Your product manager is about to go on extended leave.
- There’s a lot of information to keep up with. But you need to know it all, so you need to know what to look for. Here are some ways you can stay up to date:
  - Automated announcement lists and channels
  - Walking the floor
  - Lurking
  - Making time for reading
  - Checking in with your leadership
  - Talking with people

#### If the Terrain Is Still Difficult to Navigate, Be a Bridge

- The problems that slow down tech organizations are most often human ones: teams that don’t know how to talk to each other, decisions that nobody feels empowered to make, and power struggles.
- As you add information to your topographical map, you may find places where it’s tempting to scrawl “There be dragons” and vow to steer elsewhere. But a staff engineer can often have the most impact by going where everyone else fears to tread and making the dangerous territory easier for everyone else.
- Google’s DevOps site suggests preemptively building bridges: “Identify someone in the organization whose work you don’t understand (or whose work frustrates you, like procurement) and invite them to coffee or lunch.”

## The Treasure Map: Remind Me Where We’re Going?

- We’ve drawn two maps so far. The locator map shows where we are. The topographic map shows how we can navigate across the organization. But where are we going? That’s the purpose of our third map

#### Chasing Shiny Things

- It’s easy to overfocus on short-term goals like the current feature release or the latest unhappy App Store review. But think bigger. Where are you trying to get to? Why are you doing any of this?
- If you’re only thinking short term:
  - It’ll be harder to keep everyone going in the same direction
    - Everyone should be very clear about the course correction that will need to come after that milestone.
  - You won’t finish big things
    - If your team keeps focusing on short-term projects to solve local problems and pain points, you won’t be able to solve bigger, long-term problems that take multiple steps.
  - You’ll accumulate cruft
  - You’ll have competing initiatives
  - Engineers stop growing
    - A team that’s used to iterating on short, clearly specified goals won’t build muscle for bigger, more difficult projects and won’t be able to tell the story of why they did what they did.

#### Taking a Longer View

- Why are you doing whatever you’re doing?
  - You won’t have the real win until you’ve built the bridges, researched the steam engines, and ordered little hats for your train conductors.
  - Unless you remember where you intended to go and keep working on it, you don’t ever get to ride the train.
  - When you’re choosing a technology to invest in, often that’s because it’s an unavoidable step on the path to something else. You’re not building a new service mesh for the joy of building a service mesh; you’re building it to make your microservices framework easier to use, because you want to make it easy for new services to get set up quickly, because you want teams to be able to ship features faster. The real goal is to reduce time to market. 
- Sharing the map
  - It may take you time to dispel the fog of war and uncover the true destination of your journey. Once you do understand it, don’t keep it to yourself.
  - It’s motivational to see that you’re making progress, but it’s also surprisingly easy to forget where you were and maybe even feel like you’re getting nowhere.

#### If the Treasure Map Is Still Unclear, It Might Be Time to Draw a New One

## Your Personal Journey

- As a staff engineer, it can take longer to see the impact of your work. That means it’s harder—but also more important—to tell the story of that work.
- When you look back, you should have a narrative of what you were trying to achieve and how it went. What did you and your group accomplish together?
- When you look ahead, you should have a story too: what are you trying to do? How does your current work contribute to that goal?
