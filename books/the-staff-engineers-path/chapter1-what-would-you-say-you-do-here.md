# Chapter 1. What Would You Say You Do Here?

## What Even Is a Staff Engineer?

- But titles do matter. The Medium engineering team wrote a blog post that lays out three reasons titles are necessary: “Helping people understand that they are progressing, vesting authority in those people who might not automatically receive it, and communicating an expected competency level to the outside world.”
- As that Medium engineering article said, a job title vests authority in people who might not automatically receive it, and communicates their expected competency level. By anchoring expectations, it saves them the time and energy they would otherwise have to spend proving themselves again and again. It gives them some hours back in their week.

#### Why Do We Need Engineers Who Can See the Big Picture?

- Good decisions need context. Experienced engineers know that the answer to most technology choices is “it depends.”
- Knowing the pros and cons of a particular technology isn’t enough—you need to know the local details too. What are you trying to do? How much time, money, and patience do you have? What’s your risk tolerance? What does the business need?
- To avoid local maxima, teams need decision makers (or at least decision influencers) who can take an outsider view—who can consider the goals of multiple teams at once and choose a path that’s best for the whole organization or the whole business.
- For a small team, a manager can often function as the most experienced technologist, owning major decisions and technical direction. In a small company, a CTO can stay deeply involved in the gory details of every decision.
- But management authority can overshadow technical judgment: reports may feel uncomfortable arguing with a manager’s technical decisions even when there’s a better solution available.
- You get better outcomes and designs if experienced engineers have the time to go deep and build the context and the authority to set the right technical direction.

#### Why Do We Need Engineers Who Lead Projects That Cross Multiple Teams?

- It’s almost certain that the teams involved in any cross-team project already existed before the project was conceived and are working on other things, maybe even things that they consider more important.
- They’ll discover unexpected dependencies midway through the project. Their team boundaries have overlaps and gaps that leak into the architecture.
- No matter how carefully you overlay teams onto a huge project, some responsibilities end up not being owned by anyone, and others are claimed by two teams.
- keeping a project moving  
  - maintain a high engineering standard 
  - anticipate risks and ask hard questions 
  - informally mentoring or coaching
  - enough perspective to track down the causes and unblock the project
- Outside the project, they’re telling the story of what’s happening and why, selling the vision to the rest of the company, and explaining what the work will make possible and how the new project affects everyone.
- Ultimately, though, TPMs are responsible for delivery, not design, and not engineering quality. TPMs make sure the project gets done on time, but staff engineers make sure it’s done with high engineering standards.
- Staff engineers are responsible for ensuring the resulting systems are robust and fit well with the technology landscape of the company.

#### Why Do We Need Engineers Who Are a Good Influence?

- Even when the stakes are lower, we’re still making software for a reason. With a few R&D-ish exceptions, engineering organizations usually don’t exist just for the sake of building more technology.
- Teams need senior people who have honed their skills, who have seen what succeeds and what fails, and who will take responsibility for creating software that works.
- Staff engineers are role models. Engineering norms are set by the behavior of the most respected engineers on the project.
- If a company’s most senior engineers just write code all day, the codebase will see the benefit of their skills, but the company will miss out on the things that only they can do. This kind of technical leadership needs to be part of the job description of the person doing it. It isn’t a distraction from the job: it is the job.

## Enough Philosophy. What’s My Job?

#### You’re Not a Manager, but You Are a Leader

- First things first: staff engineering is a leadership role.
- Whether you want to or not, you’ll be a role model: other engineers will look to those with the big job titles to understand how to behave. So, no: you can’t avoid being a leader.
- Leadership comes in lots of forms that you might not immediately recognize as such.
  - designing “happy path” solutions that protect other engineers from common mistakes
  - reviewing other engineers’ code and designs  in a way that improves their confidence and skills
  - Teaching is a form of leadership.
  - Quietly raising everyone’s game is leadership.
  - Setting technical direction is leadership.
- Yes, You Can Be an Introvert. No, You Can’t Be a Jerk.

#### You’re in a “Technical” Role

- To be a good influence, you need to have high standards for what excellent engineering looks like and model them when you build something.
- Your reviews of code or designs should be instructive for your colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better.
- When you’re making technical decisions, you need to understand the trade-offs and help other people understand them too.
- Staff engineers often take on ambiguous, messy, difficult problems and do just enough work on them to make them manageable by someone else.

#### You Aim to Be Autonomous

- At staff+ levels, your manager should be bringing you information and sharing context, but you should be telling them what’s important just as much as the other way around.
- As a senior person in the organization, it’s likely that you’ll be pulled in many directions. It’s up to you to defend and structure your time.
- Autonomy demands responsibility. If the thing they asked you to work on turns out to be harmful, you have a responsibility to speak up. Don’t silently let a disaster unfold.

#### You Set Technical Direction

- Whether these decisions are made at a team level or across multiple teams or whole organizations, part of your job is to make sure that they get made, that they get made well, and that they get written down.

#### You Communicate Often and Well

- The more senior you become, the more you will rely on strong communication skills. Almost everything you do will involve conveying information from your brain to other people’s brains and vice versa. The better you are at being understood, the easier your job will be.

## Understanding Your Role

#### Where in the Organization Do You Sit?

- Reporting chains will affect the level of support you receive, the information you’re privy to, and, in many cases, how you’re perceived by colleagues outside your group.
  ###### Reporting “high”
  - Reporting “high” in the org chart, such as to a director or VP, will give you a broad perspective. The information you get will be high-level and impactful, and so will the problems you’re asked to solve.
  - You’ll probably get a lot less of your manager’s time than you would if you had a local manager. Your manager might have less visibility into your work and therefore might not be able to advocate for you or help you grow.
  
  ###### Reporting “low”
  - Chances are that you’ll get more focused attention from your manager, and you’ll be more likely to have an advocate.
  - But an engineer assigned to a single team may find it hard to influence the whole organization. Like it or not, humans pay attention to status and hierarchies—and reporting chains.

#### What’s Your Scope?

- Your reporting chain will likely affect your scope: the domain, team, or teams that you pay close attention to and have some responsibility for, even if you don’t hold any formal leadership role in this domain.
- Inside your scope, you should have some influence on short-term and long-term goals.
- You should be aware of the major decisions being made.
- Be prepared to ignore your scope when there’s a crisis.

  ###### A scope too broad

  - Lack of impact
    - If anything can be your problem, then it’s easy for everything to become your problem
    - There will always be another side quest
  - Becoming a bottleneck
  - Decision fatigue
    - If you escape the trap of trying to do everything, you’ll have the constant cost of deciding which things to do.
  - Missing relationships
  
  ###### A scope too narrow

  A common example is when a staff engineer is part of a single team, reporting to a line manager.
  - Lack of impact
    - It’s possible to spend all of your time on something that doesn’t need the expertise and focus of a staff engineer.
  - Opportunity cost
  - Overshadowing other engineers
    - A narrow scope can mean that there’s not enough work to keep you busy, and that you may overshadow less experienced people and take learning opportunities away from them.
  - Overengineering
    - When you see a vastly overengineered solution to a straightforward problem, that’s often the work of a staff engineer who should have been assigned to a harder problem.

#### What Shape Is Your Role?

###### Do you approach things depth-first or breadth-first?

- There’s no wrong answer here, but you’ll have an easier and more enjoyable time if your preference here is lined up with your scope.

###### Which of the “four disciplines” do you gravitate toward?

- Core technical skills
  - Coding, litigation, producing content, cooking—whatever a typical practitioner of the role works on
- Product management
  - Figuring out what needs to be done and why, and maintaining a narrative about that work
- Project management
  - The practicalities of achieving the goal, removing chaos, tracking the tasks, noticing what’s blocked, and making sure it gets unblocked
- People management
  - Turning a group of people into a team, building their skills and careers, mentoring, and dealing with their problems

Every team and every project needs all four of these skills. As a staff engineer, you’ll use all of them. You don’t need to be amazing at all of them, though.

###### How much do you want (or need) to code?

- If you’re going to feel antsy unless you’re in code every day, make sure you’re not taking on a broad architectural or influence-based role where you just won’t have time.

###### How’s your delayed gratification?

- If you’re going to be anxious and stressed out on a project with longer feedback cycles, ask a manager who you trust to tell you, regularly and honestly, how things are going. If you need that and don’t have it, consider projects that pay off on a shorter timescale.

###### Do any of these archetypes fit you?

- In his article “Staff Archetypes”, Will Larson describes four distinct patterns he’s seen staff engineering roles take. You can use these archetypes as you define the kind of role you have, or would like to have:
- Tech leads
  - Partner with managers to guide the execution of one or more teams.
- Architects
  - Responsible for technical direction and quality across a critical area.
- Solvers
  - Wade into one difficult problem at a time.
- Right hands
  - Add leadership bandwidth to an organization.
  
#### What’s Your Primary Focus?

- In some cases, your manager or someone they report to will have strong opinions about where you should focus, or will even have hired you specifically to solve a particular problem. Most of the time, though, you’ll have some autonomy in deciding what’s most important. Every time you choose what to work on, you’re also choosing what not to do, so be deliberate and thoughtful about what you take on.

###### What’s important?

- “Your work needs to be important” doesn’t mean you should only work on the fanciest, most glamorous technologies and VP-sponsored initiatives. The work that’s most important will often be the work that nobody else sees. It might be a struggle to even articulate the need for it, because your teams don’t have good mental models for it yet. It might involve gathering data that doesn’t exist, or spelunking through dusty code or documents that haven’t been touched in a decade. There are any number of other grungy tasks that just need to get done. Meaningful work comes in many forms.

###### What needs you?

- Be wary of choosing a project that already has a lot of senior people on it.
- Try to choose a problem that actually needs you and that will benefit from your attention. 

## Aligning on Scope, Shape, and Primary Focus

- A technique I learned from my friend Cian Synnott is to write out my understanding of my job and share it with my manager.
- Don’t obsess about getting this perfect: get it right enough. Describing your goals doesn’t mean you’re forbidden from doing something else. But it’s a nice reminder of what you intended to do, and it helps you keep an eye on whether you’re actually doing the thing you claimed was your job.

#### Is That Your Job?

- Your job is to make your organization successful.
- Usually this “not my job” work is less dramatic, of course. It can mean having a dozen conversations to unblock a project your team depends on, or noticing that your new engineer is lost and checking in with them. To reiterate: your job is ultimately whatever your organization or company needs it to be.

## To Recap

- Staff engineering roles are ambiguous by definition. It’s up to you to discover and decide what your role is and what it means for you.
- You’re probably not a manager, but you’re in a leadership role.
- Be clear about your scope: your area of responsibility and influence.
- Your time is finite. Be deliberate about choosing a primary focus that’s important and that isn’t wasting your skills.
- Align with your management chain. Discuss what you think your job is, see what your manager thinks it is, understand what’s valued and what’s actually useful, and set expectations explicitly. Not all companies need all shapes of staff engineers.
- Your job will be a weird shape sometimes, and that’s OK.
