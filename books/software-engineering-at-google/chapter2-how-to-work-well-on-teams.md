# Chapter 2. How to Work Well on Teams

## Help Me Hide My Code

- People are afraid of others seeing and judging their work in progress. In one sense, insecurity is just a part of human nature—nobody likes to be criticized, especially for things that aren’t finished. Recognizing this theme tipped us off to a more general trend within software development: insecurity is actually a symptom of a larger problem.

## The Genius Myth

- Linux is hundreds of times bigger than that initial kernel and was developed by thousands of smart people. Linus’ real achievement was to lead these people and coordinate their work; Linux is the shining result not of his original idea, but of the collective labor  of the community.
- The Genius Myth is the tendency that we as humans need to ascribe the success of a team to a single person/leader.

## Hiding Considered Harmful

- If you spend all of your time working alone, you’re increasing the risk of unnecessary failure and cheating your potential for growth.
- First of all, how do you even know whether you’re on the right track?

#### Early Detection

- The chances of an early misstep are high. The more feedback you solicit early on, the more you lower this risk. Remember the tried-and-true mantra of “Fail early, fail fast, fail often.”
- Early sharing isn’t just about preventing personal missteps and getting your ideas vetted. It’s also important to strengthen what we call the bus factor of your project.

#### The Bus Factor

- _Bus factor (noun): the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your project is completely doomed._
- Beyond the bus factor, there’s the issue of overall pace of progress. It’s easy to forget that working alone is often a tough slog, much slower than people want to admit.
- How much do you learn when working alone? How fast do you move? Google and Stack Overflow are great sources of opinions and information, but they’re no substitute for actual human experience. Working with other people directly increases the collective wisdom behind the effort
- Programming is hard. Software engineering is even harder. You need that second pair of eyes.

#### Pace of Progress

- The current DevOps philosophy toward tech productivity is explicit about these sorts of goals: get feedback as early as possible, test as early as possible, and think about security and production environments as early as possible. This is all bundled into the idea of “shifting left” in the developer workflow; the earlier we find a problem, the cheaper it is to fix it.
- Requirements morph unexpectedly. How do you get that feedback loop so that you know the instant your plans or designs need to change? Answer: by working in a team.
- You can have all the uninterrupted time in the world, but if you’re using it to work on the wrong thing, you’re wasting your time.
- Don’t misunderstand us—we still think engineers need uninterrupted time to focus on writing code, but we think they need a high-bandwidth, low-friction connection to their team just as much. If less-knowledgeable people on your team feel that there’s a barrier to asking you a question, it’s a problem: finding the right balance is an art.

#### In Short, Don’t Hide

-  Even though you might be afraid of someone stealing your idea or thinking you’re not intelligent, you should be much more concerned about wasting huge swaths of your time toiling away on the wrong thing.

## It’s All About the Team

- Let’s put this idea into simpler words: software engineering is a team endeavor.

#### The Three Pillars of Social Interaction

- To reach collaborative nirvana, you first need to learn and embrace what I call the “three pillars” of social skills.
  ###### Pillar 1: Humility
  - You are not the center of the universe (nor is your code!). You’re neither omniscient nor infallible. You’re open to self-improvement.
  ###### Pillar 2: Respect
  - You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them kindly and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.
  ###### Pillar 3: Trust
  - You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate.

#### Why Do These Pillars Matter?

- The moral is this: do not underestimate the power of playing the social game. It’s not about tricking or manipulating people; it’s about creating relationships to get things done.
- Relationships always outlast projects. When you’ve got richer relationships with your coworkers, they’ll be more willing to go the extra mile when you need them.

#### Humility, Respect, and Trust in Practice

###### Lose the ego

- Nobody wants to work with someone who consistently behaves like they’re the most important person in the room. Even if you know you’re the wisest person in the discussion, don’t wave it in people’s faces.
- Although it’s important to be humble, that doesn’t mean you need to be a doormat; there’s nothing wrong with self-confidence. Just don’t come off like a know-it-all.

###### Learn to give and take criticism

- In a professional software engineering environment, criticism is almost never personal—it’s usually just part of the process of making a better project. The trick is to make sure you (and those around you) understand the difference between a constructive criticism of someone’s creative output and a flat-out assault against someone’s character.

###### Fail fast and iterate

- At Google, one of our favorite mottos is that “Failure is an option.” It’s widely recognized that if you’re not failing now and then, you’re not being innovative enough or taking enough risks.

#### Blameless Post-Mortem Culture

- Properly documenting failures also makes it easier for other people (present and future) to know what happened and avoid repeating history. Don’t erase your tracks—light them up like a runway for those who follow you!

###### Learn patience

###### Be open to influence

- The more open you are to influence, the more you are able to influence; the more vulnerable you are, the stronger you appear.
- it’s OK for someone else to change your mind.
- Admitting that you’ve made a mistake or you’re simply out of your league can increase your status over the long run. In fact, the willingness to express vulnerability is an outward show of humility, it demonstrates accountability and the willingness to take responsibility, and it’s a signal that you trust others’ opinions.

#### Being Googley

###### Thrives in ambiguity

- Can deal with conflicting messages or directions, build consensus, and make progress against a problem, even when the environment is constantly shifting.

###### Values feedback

- Has humility to both receive and give feedback gracefully and understands how valuable feedback is for personal (and team) development.

###### Challenges status quo

- Is able to set ambitious goals and pursue them even when there might be resistance or inertia from others.

###### Puts the user first

- Has empathy and respect for users of Google’s products and pursues actions that are in their best interests.

###### Cares about the team

- Has empathy and respect for coworkers and actively works to help them without being asked, improving team cohesion.

###### Does the right thing

- Has a strong sense of ethics about everything they do; willing to make difficult or inconvenient decisions to protect the integrity of the team and product.

## Conclusion

- The foundation for almost any software endeavor—of almost any size—is a well-functioning team. Although the Genius Myth of the solo software developer still persists, the truth is that no one really goes it alone.
- the creative nature of software development requires that people take risks and occasionally fail; for people to accept that failure, a healthy team environment must exist.
