# Chapter 5. How to Lead a Team

## Managers and Tech Leads (and Both)

#### The Engineering Manager

- At the highest level, an engineering manager is responsible for the performance, productivity, and happiness of every person on their team—including their tech lead—while still making sure that the needs of the business are met by the product for which they are responsible.

#### The Tech Lead

- The tech lead (TL) of a team—who will often report to the manager of that team—is responsible for (surprise!) the technical aspects of the product, including technology decisions and choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project management (although on larger teams they might have program managers helping out with this).

#### The Tech Lead Manager

- On small and nascent teams for which engineering managers need a strong technical skill set, the default is often to have a TLM: a single person who can handle both the people and technical needs of their team.

## Moving from an Individual Contributor Role to a Leadership Role

- Understanding the ins and outs of leadership is a vital skill for influencing the direction of your work.

#### The Only Thing to Fear Is…Well, Everything

- There are, however, great reasons to consider becoming a TL or manager. First, it’s a way to scale yourself. Even if you’re great at writing code, there’s still an upper limit to the amount of code you can write. Imagine how much code a team of great engineers could write under your leadership!
- Second, you might just be really good at it—many people who find themselves sucked into the leadership vacuum of a project discover that they’re exceptionally skilled at providing the kind of guidance, help, and air cover a team or a company needs.

#### Servant Leadership

- There seems to be a sort of disease that strikes managers in which they forget about all the awful things their managers did to them and suddenly begin doing these same things to “manage” the people that report to them.
- The symptoms of this disease include, but are by no means limited to, micromanaging, ignoring low performers, and hiring pushovers.
- The cure for the “management” disease is a liberal application of “servant leadership,” which is a nice way of saying the most important thing you can do as a leader is to serve your team

## The Engineering Manager

#### Manager Is a Four-Letter Word

#### Today’s Engineering Manager

- Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).
- A common saying at Google is that if you try to achieve an impossible goal, there’s a good chance you’ll fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you’ll most likely accomplish far more than you would have accomplished had you merely attempted something you knew you could complete.
- So, let’s get that out of the way: it’s OK to fail. In fact, we like to think of failure as a way of learning a lot really quickly (provided that you’re not repeatedly failing at the same thing). In addition, it’s important to see failure as an opportunity to learn and not to point fingers or assign blame.
- It’s alright to fail, but fail as a team and learn from your failures.
- If an individual succeeds, praise them in front of the team. If an individual fails, give constructive criticism in private.

## Antipatterns

#### Antipattern: Hire Pushovers

- If you’re a manager and you’re feeling insecure in your role (for whatever reason), one way to make sure no one questions your authority or threatens your job is to hire people you can push around.
- Instead, you should strive to hire people who are smarter than you and can replace you.
- it’s a lot easier to expand your expertise when surrounded by people who are smarter than you.

#### Antipattern: Ignore Low Performers

- It’s never any fun to pull teeth. We’ve seen team leaders do all the right things to build incredibly strong teams only to have these teams fail to excel (and eventually fall apart) because of just one or two low performers.
- Google’s Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team has a motto: “Hope is not a strategy.” And nowhere is hope more overused as a strategy than in dealing with a low performer.
- While the leader is hoping and the low performer isn’t improving (or leaving), high performers on the team waste valuable time pulling the low performer along, and team morale leaks away into the ether.
- If you immediately deal with a low performer, you’ll often find that they merely need some encouragement or direction to slip into a higher state of productivity.
- If the low performer can’t keep up, it will become quite obvious to both of you early in the process. At this point, the person will often acknowledge that things aren’t going well and decide to quit; in other cases, determination will kick in and they’ll “up their game” to meet expectations.

#### Antipattern: Ignore Human Issues

- It’s tempting to focus all of your energy on the technical side of your team because, as an individual contributor, you spend the vast majority of your time solving technical problems. When you were a student, your classes were all about learning the technical ins and outs of your work. Now that you’re a manager, however, you ignore the human element of your team at your own peril.

#### Antipattern: Be Everyone’s Friend

- Remember that you can lead a team and build consensus without being a close friend of your team (or a monumental hard-ass).

#### Antipattern: Compromise the Hiring Bar

- Without the raw materials for a great team, you’re doomed.

#### Antipattern: Treat Your Team Like Children

- what about the costs of having a workforce that behaves like children or that has to waste valuable time formally requesting cheap office supplies? Surely that’s more expensive than the price of a few pens and USB cables. 

## Positive Patterns

#### Lose the Ego

- Part of “losing the ego” is trust: you need to trust your team. That means respecting the abilities and prior accomplishments of the team members, even if they’re new to your team.
- Most people new to a leadership role feel an enormous responsibility to get everything right, to know everything, and to have all the answers. We can assure you that you will not get everything right, nor will you have all the answers, and if you act like you do, you’ll quickly lose the respect of your team.
- The last part of losing the ego is a simple one, but many engineers would rather be boiled in oil than do it: apologize when you make a mistake.
- Apologizing doesn’t cost money. People have enormous respect for leaders who apologize when they screw up, and contrary to popular belief, apologizing doesn’t make you vulnerable.

#### Be a Zen Master

- Mediating your reactions and maintaining your calm is more important as you lead more people, because your team will (both unconsciously and consciously) look to you for clues on how to act and react to whatever is going on around you.
- One of the early managers at Google, Bill Coughran, a VP of engineering, had truly mastered the ability to maintain calm at all times. No matter what blew up, no matter what crazy thing happened, no matter how big the firestorm, Bill would never panic. Most of the time he’d place one arm across his chest, rest his chin in his hand, and ask questions about the problem, usually to a completely panicked engineer. This had the effect of calming them and helping them to focus on solving the problem instead of running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Some of us used to joke that if someone came in and told Bill that 19 of the company’s offices had been attacked by space aliens, Bill’s response would be, “Any idea why they didn’t make it an even 20?”
- This brings us to another Zen management trick: asking questions.
- Whether or not you have the answer, using this technique will almost always leave the employee with the impression that you did. Tricky, eh? Socrates would be proud of you.

#### Be a Catalyst

- One of the most common things a team leader does is to build consensus.

#### Remove Roadblocks

- Sometimes, your team already has consensus about what you need to do, but it hit a roadblock and became stuck. This could be a technical or organizational roadblock, but jumping in to help the team get moving again is a common leadership technique.
- You don’t need to know all the answers to help remove roadblocks, but it usually helps to know the people who do.

#### Be a Teacher and a Mentor

- One of the most difficult things to do as a TL is to watch a more junior team member spend 3 hours working on something that you know you can knock out in 20 minutes.
- Teaching people and giving them a chance to learn on their own can be incredibly difficult at first, but it’s a vital component of effective leadership.

#### Set Clear Goals

- The easiest way to set a clear goal and get your team pulling the product in the same direction is to create a concise mission statement for the team. After you’ve helped the team define its direction and goals, you can step back and give it more autonomy, periodically checking in to make sure everyone is still on the right track.

#### Be Honest

- We strongly advise against using the compliment sandwich, not because we think you should be unnecessarily cruel or harsh, but because most people won’t hear the critical message, which is that something needs to change.
- When you’re providing direct feedback or criticism, your delivery is key to making sure that your message is heard and not deflected.

#### Track Happiness

- A good simple way to track your team’s happiness is to ask the team member at the end of each one-on-one meeting, “What do you need?”

## The Unexpected Question

## Other Tips and Tricks

#### Delegate, but get your hands dirty

#### Seek to replace yourself

- Unless you want to keep doing the exact same job for the rest of your career, seek to replace yourself. This starts, as we mentioned earlier, with the hiring process: if you want a member of your team to replace you, you need to hire people capable of replacing you, which we usually sum up by saying that you need to “hire people smarter than you.”

#### Know when to make waves

- By waiting, you’re only delaying the inevitable and causing untold damage in the process. So act, and act quickly.

#### Shield your team from chaos

#### Give your team air cover

- Share as much information as you can with your team, but don’t distract them with organizational craziness that is extremely unlikely to ever actually affect them.

#### Let your team know when they’re doing well

#### It’s easy to say “yes” to something that’s easy to undo

- Really good leaders have a good sense for when something can be undone, but more things are undoable than you think (and this applies to both technical and nontechnical decisions).

## People Are Like Plants

- To get all of your team members what they need, you need to motivate the ones who are in a rut and provide stronger direction to those who are distracted or uncertain of what to do.
- you don’t want to give them too much of either—because if they don’t need motivation or direction and you try giving it to them, you’re just going to annoy them.

#### Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Motivation

- There are two types of motivation: extrinsic, which originates from outside forces (such as monetary compensation), and intrinsic, which comes from within.
- In his book Drive, Dan Pink explains that the way to make people the happiest and most productive isn’t to motivate them extrinsically (e.g., throw piles of cash at them); rather, you need to work to increase their intrinsic motivation. Dan claims you can increase intrinsic motivation by giving people three things: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

## Conclusion

## TL;DRs

- Don’t “manage” in the traditional sense; focus on leadership, influence, and serving your team.
- Delegate where possible; don’t DIY (Do It Yourself).
- Pay particular attention to the focus, direction, and velocity of your team.
