# Chapter 4. Engineering for Equity

## Bias Is the Default

- When engineers do not focus on users of different nationalities, ethnicities, races, genders, ages, socioeconomic statuses, abilities, and belief systems, even the most talented staff will inadvertently fail their users.
- Unconscious bias is insidious and often more difficult to mitigate than intentional acts of exclusion.
- By the same token, our organizations must also recognize that such bias exists and work to address it in their workforces, product development, and user outreach.

## Understanding the Need for Diversity

- At Google, we believe that being an exceptional engineer requires that you also focus on bringing diverse perspectives into product design and implementation.
- The most difficult users to consider are those who are disenfranchised by the processes and the environment in which they access technology. To address this challenge, engineering teams need to be representative of their existing and future users.

## Building Multicultural Capacity

- One mark of an exceptional engineer is the ability to understand how products can advantage and disadvantage different groups of human beings.
- The first step is to recognize the default state of your bias caused by many societal and educational factors. After you recognize this, you’ll be able to consider the often-forgotten use cases or users who can benefit or be harmed by the products you build.
- Focusing on underrepresented users is a clear opportunity to promote equity.
- Change requires that each of us, individually or as leaders of teams, invest in continuous professional development that builds not just our software development and leadership skills, but also our capacity to understand the diverse experiences throughout humanity.

## Making Diversity Actionable

- Every technology lead or software engineering manager has the means to augment equity on their teams. It is important that we acknowledge that, although there are significant systemic challenges, we are all part of the system. It is our problem to fix.

## Reject Singular Approaches

- We cannot perpetuate solutions that present a single philosophy or methodology for fixing inequity in the technology sector. Our problems are complex and multifactorial.
- Designing for the user who is least like you is not just wise, it’s a best practice.
- Focus on the most difficult or least represented use case first.

## Challenge Established Processes

## Values Versus Outcomes

- Take a hard look in the mirror.
- Don’t build for everyone. Build with everyone.
- Design for the user who will have the most difficulty using your product.
- Don’t assume equity; measure equity throughout your systems.
- Change is possible.

## Stay Curious, Push Forward

## Conclusion

## TL;DRs

- Diversity is necessary to design properly for a comprehensive user base.
- Product velocity must be evaluated against providing a product that is truly useful to all users. It’s better to slow down than to release a product that might cause harm to some users.
